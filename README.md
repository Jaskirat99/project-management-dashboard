# Construction Project Management 

## Keeping track of your projects so you don't have to!

This project helps log and track costs of projects and then 
keeps track of all the analytics including estimated profits,
costs, tax, realtor commission and much more! You will be able
to start a project and then add cost entries as they occur. 
Then on your dashboard you will be presented with all the 
information you need to make sure you remain **informed** on the 
**analytics** of your **business**!

Personally, my family works in construction and we 
build homes for clients but also for ourselves and then sell after construction. For these personal projects, in order to keep 
track of all the properties and projects and their 
corresponding costs and calculations we have a complicated 
system of spreadsheets that I manage. These spreadsheets 
give us insight into our costs, profits, taxes etc. 
However, due to complicated formulas needed, it is prone 
to easily breaking, and is limited in its automation and 
user-friendliness. This project is meant to rework that idea
and build something that is much easier to scale, and much easier
to use
